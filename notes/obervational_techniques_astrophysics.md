# Observational techniques in astrophysics: Imaging

## Charge-coupled device

In a CCD image sensor, pixels are represented by p-doped
metal-oxide-semiconductors (MOS) capacitors.  There is a photoactive region
(silicon layer), and a transmission region. When photons hit the capacitor
array, then each capacitor accumulates an electric charge proportional to the
light intensity at that location. Once the array has been exposed to the image,
a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer its contents to its neighbor
(operating as a shift register).

## Sources of noise

CCD images are not perfect and contain a lot of noise, which needs to be dealt
with before those images can be used to do science. The follwoing are some types
of noise.

### Read noise

This is the noise introduced in each pixel when we read out the device. There
are, e.g., quantum effects, gaps between pixels, and analog-to-digital
converters that add noise.

### Dark current

### Bias

### Gain & dynamic Range
