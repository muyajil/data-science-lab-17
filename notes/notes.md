# TIL about cnns
Standard object detection cnns require multiple passes over the image to identify and locate multiple objects.
In a traditional cnn, there are two fully-connected (non-convolutional) layers as the final layers of the network. 
Moving-window methods are able to produce rectangular bounding boxes, but cannot produce object silhouettes.
